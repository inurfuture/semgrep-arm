# semgrep-arm

Because of the single file size limit, I split the compressed package into two

After merging the compressed packages and unzipping them, you have two files

----semgrep-core

semgrep-core version: 1.17.1

compiled semgrep-core on the centos7 arrch64 version, which relies on glibc version 2.18

----libtree-sitter.so.0.0

library required by the binary file runtime
